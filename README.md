# compression-algorythm
How I learned and wrote my compression algorithm.

## Part 1: Basic knowledge of C
- [x] Learn what variables, types, and operators are (`int`, `char`, `float`, `unsigned`, `+ - * / %`).
- [x] Learn **loops** (`for`, `while`) and **conditions** (`if`, `switch`).
- [x] Learn **functions** — parameters, return values.
- [x] Learn **arrays** (1D and 2D).
- [ ] Learn **pointers**:
    - What `*` and `&` mean
    - Pointer arithmetic
    - Pointer to array and pointer to pointer
- [x] Write simple programs:
    - Sum of two numbers        
    - Find min/max in array    
    - Reverse array
- [ ] Learn **memory allocation** (`malloc`, `calloc`, `free`).
- [ ] Practice **structs** — create a struct for RGB pixel.
- [ ] Learn **file I/O**:    
    - `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread`, `fwrite`
    - Read and write small binary files.
Main project: 
1. Read 10 numbers from file, double them, and save to a new file.
